                <p>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, nicknamed The World Game or The Beautiful
                    Game, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played
                    by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport.
                    The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score
                    by getting the ball into the opposing goal.The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the
                    ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and only in their penalty area. Other players mainly
                    use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use their head or torso. The team that scores
                    the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw
                    is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition.
                    The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association
                    football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French:
                    Fédération Internationale de Football Association), which organises World Cups for both men and women
                    every four years.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="body">
                <p>There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines.
                    The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups
                    such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often
                    framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game.
                    The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association
                    Board (IFAB). In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute
                    to the regulation of football.</p>

            <div class="body">
                <p>According to FIFA, the Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠, literally "kick ball") is the earliest form of
                    football for which there is scientific evidence. Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from
                    hands and the intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern
                    football, though similarities to rugby occurred. During the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), cuju games
                    were standardised and rules were established.Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games. An image
                    of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a vase at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens
                    appears on the UEFA European Championship Cup. Athenaeus, writing in 228 AD, referenced the Roman ball
                    game harpastum. Phaininda, episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence. They all
                    appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern
                    football. As with pre-codified "mob football", the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three
                    games involved more handling the ball than kicking. Non-competitive games included kemari in Japan, chuk-guk
                    in Korea and woggabaliri in Australia.</p>
