        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Sprinting is running over a short distance in a limited period of time. It is used in many sports that incorporate running,
            typically as a way of quickly reaching a target or goal, or avoiding or catching an opponent. Human physiology
            dictates that a runner's near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than 30–35 seconds due to the depletion
            of phosphocreatine stores in muscles, and perhaps secondarily to excessive metabolic acidosis as a result of
            anaerobic glycolysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            In athletics and track and field, sprints (or dashes) are races over short distances. They are among the oldest running competitions.
            The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games featured only one event—the stadion race, which was a race
            from one end of the stadium to the other. There are three sprinting events which are currently held at the Summer
            Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres. These events have their
            roots in races of imperial measurements which were later altered to metric: the 100 m evolved from the 100-yard
            dash, the 200 m distance came from the furlong (or ​1⁄8 mile), and the 400 m was the successor to the 440-yard
            dash or quarter-mile race.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before leaning
            forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. The set
            position differs depending on the start. Body alignment is of key importance in producing the optimal amount
            of force. Ideally the athlete should begin in a 4-point stance and push off using both legs for maximum force
            production. Athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events, with the sole
            exception of the 400 m indoors. Races up to 100 m are largely focused upon acceleration to an athlete's maximum
            speed. All sprints beyond this distance increasingly incorporate an element of endurance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 60 metres is a common indoor event and it is an indoor world championship event. Less common events include the 50 metres,
            55 metres, 300 metres, and 500 metres which are used in some high school and collegiate competitions in the United
            States.

                400 m) and relay events (first leg only, up to 4x400 m).[15] The starting blocks consist of two adjustable
                footplates attached to a rigid frame. Races commence with the firing of the starter's gun.[15] The starting
                commands are "On your marks" and "Set".[15] Once all athletes are in the set position, the starter's gun
                is fired, officially starting the race. For the 100 m, all competitors are lined up side-by-side. For the
                200 m, 300 m and 400 m, which involve curves, runners are staggered for the start.

                Sprint lanes in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden as seen from the 100 m starting point According to the IAAF rules, "An athlete, after
                assuming a full and final set position, shall not commence his starting motion until after receiving the
                report of the gun, or approved starting apparatus. If, in the judgement of the Starter or Recallers, he does
                so any earlier, it shall be deemed a false start."

        <div id="lanes">
            <h3>Lanes</h3>
            <p>
                For all Olympic sprint events, runners must remain within their pre-assigned lanes, which measure 1.22 metres (4 feet) wide,
                from start to finish.[16] The lanes can be numbered 1 through 8, 9, or rarely 10, starting with the inside
                lane. Any athlete who runs outside the assigned lane to gain an advantage is subject to disqualification.
                If the athlete is forced to run outside of his or her lane by another person, and no material advantage is
                gained, there will be no disqualification. Also, a runner who strays from his or her lane in the straightaway,
                or crosses the outer line of his or her lane on the bend, and gains no advantage by it, will not be disqualified
                as long as no other runner is obstructed.

                The first athlete whose torso reaches the vertical plane of the closest edge of the finish line is the winner. To ensure
                that the sprinter's torso triggers the timing impulse at the finish line rather than an arm, foot, or other
                body part, a double Photocell is commonly used. Times are only recorded by an electronic timing system when
                both of these Photocells are simultaneously blocked. Photo finish systems are also used at some track and
                field events.

            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <p>
                The first Greek Olympics took place in 776 B.C. It lasted for one day and featured sacrifices in honor of the Greek gods,
                especially Zeus. The only athletic event was a sprint from one end of the race course to the other. It was
                called a stadion, or stade, and its distance was about 630 feet. This single running race continued to be
                the only athletic event in several successive Olympics.

            <h3>The Olympiad</h3>
            <p>
                Like their modern counterpart, the Greek Olympics occurred every four years. The four-year period between Olympic Games became
                a Greek measure of time called the Olympiad. For about 400 years, each Olympiad was named after the athlete
                who had won the running race in the last Olympics. For example, because an athlete named Koroibos was the
                victor in the first Olympics in 776, the subsequent four-year period was called the Olympiad of Koroibos.

            <h3>Expansion of Olympics</h3>
            <p>
                Eventually the Olympics became a five-day event and included other contests, such as boxing and the pentathlon. In the pentathlon,
                the athlete participated in five events, including a sprint. There was also a sprint twice as long as a stade.
                However, the original stade continued to be the chief event, and its popularity continued until Emperor Theodosius
                I abolished the games in 394 A.D.

            <h3>Early Revival Attempts</h3>
            <p>
                The French tried to revive the Olympics during the French Revolution. Contests were held three years in a row from 1796 to
                1798. The French had recently invented the metric system, so for the first time, Olympic athletes competed
                on race tracks measured in meters. Running races were also included in other attempts to revive the Olympics,
                such as the Grand Olympic Festival, which took place in Liverpool during the 1860s. Greece also attempted
                to revive the Olympics at about the same time. This revival, called the Olympia of Zappas, featured a re-enactment
                of the ancient stade sprint.

            <h3>Modern Olympics</h3>
            <p>
                When the modern Olympic Games began in 1896, sprinters ran a 100-meter dash and a 400-meter dash. A 200-meter dash was added
                in the 1900 Olympics, and teams of four sprinters began to run relay races in the 1912 Olympics. Women’s
                sprint events were added in the 1928 Olympics. The format of the races changed. Ropes, which originally separated
                the sprinting lanes, were eventually discarded. Olympic sprinters first started races from an upright position,
                sometimes with starting gates that opened up when the race began, but starting blocks were introduced in
                the 1948 Olympics, and runners now start from a crouched position. Running conditions have improved. In 1956,
                Olympic sprinters began to run on synthetic tracks and sports apparel became lighter and more user-friendly.
                Performance has improved over the years. For example, in the 1986 Olympics, Thomas Burke won the 100-meter
                dash in a time of 12.0 seconds, but in 2008, Usain Bolt ran it in 9.69 seconds to set a world record.
